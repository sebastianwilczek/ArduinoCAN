# ArduinoCAN

This repository contains scripts to load on Arduinos connected to CAN shields, to enable them to communicate over a CAN bus.

Aside from basic write and read operations, security extensions are included to experiment how CAN can be secured against malicious ECUs. Please note that these implementations are not necessarily cryptographic and should NOT be used in practise. This implementation serves as a proof of concept.
